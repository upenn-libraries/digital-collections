      Purpose
    </h2>
    <p>This website exists to make available thousands of digitized original
      materials, from historical documents to photos, manuscripts, and more.
      Our goal is to preserve these works and share them with youâ€”whether
      you're researching a topic or just browsing, we hope you find something
      that sparks your curiosity.</p>
    <p>At the center of these digitized materials is the
      <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/sceti">Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text & Image (SCETI)</a>. SCETI is dedicated to digitizing rare and fragile materials, making it
      possible to offer these original materials online.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">
      Copyright
    </h2>
    <p>Collections are as accessible as possible, while respecting copyright
      laws. If you have questions about using materials, the Copyright Advisor
      is available to answer any questions and can help you navigate
      permissions and usage rights.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">
      Platform
    </h2>
    <p>
      We use a customized
      <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>
      application. The application relies on
      <a href="https://ceph.io/en/">Ceph</a>
      for asset storage, chosen for its high availability, high replication,
      performance, and fault tolerance. Git and git-annex are used to track
      changes to objects over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data complies with
      <a href="https://iiif.io/">International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)</a>
      standards, ensuring high-quality images, interoperability with other
      image viewers, and the ability to download digital materials.
